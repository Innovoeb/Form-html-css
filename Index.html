      <p id="Intro-Paragraph">My name is Beovonni Glover and I am currently enrolled in the spring 2019
      semester at PunchCode Las Vegas. The purpose of me attending this program is to learn about web development and hopefully initiate a carrer as a web developer. The biggest value PunchCode's program can give to me
      is training me on how to think and learn like a computer programmer. After only one day of class, I am certain that PunchCode
      will equip me with the knowledge of technologies and techniques used by professional web developers daily. In the coming weeks with PunchCode,
      I plan to sharpen my programming skills and broaden my knowledge of technologies in order to become a capable developer.
      </p>

      <p id="Paragraph1">My knowledge of the basic web technologies prior to the program are slim although I am sure this will change
        after the program. I have flirted with some HTML and acquired some familiarity with it over the last few months.
        For example, I know how to display an input element on my DOM like so...
      <input></input>
      <br>
      <br>
      I know that this is a way to make it possible for a user to interact with my web page but unfortunately, I do not know how to build on top of this as in how to tell my page to perform an action after
      information or data has been submitted in the input space. I do know that this will change sooner than later once I spend time with javascript through
      my PunchCode coursework.
      </p>

      <p id="Paragraph2">What originally sparked my interest in computer programming was a yearning to learn how to develop video games. With this new found interest
        I became familiar with some programming skills such as how to make a button element and apply a function to the onclick event handler of said button. If I have learned and understood correctly, the event would be a user clicking on my button element, the handler would be an onclick attribute in
        my script, and both an event and event handler are paramount concepts to grasp when it comes to video game development. In this homework assignment
        I will attempt to perform a simple task such as manipulate the DOM once my button element has been pressed.

    <button id="clusionbttn" onclick="myConclusion()">Click Me</button>

    <script>

      // This is my onclick event handler
      function myConclusion() {
        document.getElementById("essay").innerHTML = "To conclude, I look forward to the upcoming weeks where I will continue to learn and further develop my programming skills. I understand that the process will be long and arduous but I am ready for the challenge."
        let elem = document.getElementById("clusionbttn");
        elem.parentNode.removeChild(elem);
      }
    </script>
